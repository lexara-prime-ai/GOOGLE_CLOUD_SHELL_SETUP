# Google Cloud Shell Development Setup Scripts

This repository provides scripts to help set up a fully functional development environment in [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell). It automates the installation of common development tools and configuration settings, allowing you to start coding in minutes without manual setup.

## Features

- **Automated Setup**: Quickly configure your development environment without hassle.
- **Tool Installation**: Installs essential development tools like:
  - Docker
  - Git
  - Node.js/Python/Rust (or any other programming languages required)
  - Cloud SDK and other Google Cloud tools
- **Environment Configuration**: Automatically configures environment variables and shell preferences.
- **Seamless Integration**: Leverages Google Cloud Shellâ€™s pre-built environment for cloud-native development.

## Requirements

To use these scripts, you need:

- A Google Cloud account with access to [Google Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/).
- Basic familiarity with the command line.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
